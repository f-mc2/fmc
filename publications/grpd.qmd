This project aims to investigate the use of groupoids in the context of quantum mechanics, quantum information theory, and quantum field theory. 
The idea of associating a groupoid with a quantum system may be traced back to [Schwingerâ€™s seminal work](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-04589-3).

The list is ordered according to the date of publication/arXiv submission, and not the date of creation.
