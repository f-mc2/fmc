To be honest, instead of “Information geometry”, I should have written “Geometrical, categorical, and statistical aspects of states on C*-algebras/von Neumann algebras/Jordan algebras”, but it may have been perceived as being a little too much for a title.

This is the theoretical playground in which I pass the vast majority of my spare time, and I plan (somewhen) to write down a better description of how entertaining it is. 

The list is ordered according to the date of publication/arXiv submission, and not the date of creation.
