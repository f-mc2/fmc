# Distance and intervals

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a function. The notion of limit formalizes, rigorously, what happens to the output when the inputs gets closer and closer to a fixed value. Roughly speaking, we write

$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}} f(x)=l 
$$

meaning that the output $f(x)$ gets closer to $l$ if the input $x$ is closer to $x_{0}$. 

::: {.callout-important title="Remark"}
Note that, in general, it is not always true that a limit exists.

In order to make things precise, we first need to understand what does it mean for a real number to be closer to a fixed real number. Essentially, we need to specify a way to measure distances between real numbers.

Intuitively speaking, if we fix $x_{0}\in \mathbb{R}$, we say that $x_{1}$ is closer than $x_{2}$ if the distance $\Delta_{1}$ between $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ is smaller than the distance $\Delta_{2}$ between $x_{2}$ and $x_{0}$, which brings the question: what is the distance between two real numbers? Graphycally speaking,  we can exploit the idea that real numbers make up a straight line, and obtain the distance between two points as the length, as would be measured by a ruler, of the piece of the real line connecting the two points (see @fig-realline-distance).

In mathematical symbols, we have
$$
\Delta_{1}\equiv|x_{1}- x_{0}|\leq |x_{2} - x_{0}|\equiv \Delta_{2}.

::: {.callout-note title="Euclidean distance function"}
The two-point function $d\colon \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ given by
$$
d(x,y)=\sqrt{(x-y)^{2}}=|x-y|
$${#eq-euclidean-distance-function}
is referred to as a **Euclidean distance function** on $\mathbb{R}$.
:::

 
 
::: {.callout-important title="Remark"}
An intuitive reason for $d$ in @eq-euclidean-distance-function to measure distances follows from our direct experience, for instance with ruled paper (can you guess why/how?),  but there are also more abstract reasons connected with the theory of [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space).
:::

Besides the notion of distance between real numbers, we need to introduce various types of intervals. These objects help in formalizing the way $x$ approaches $x_{0}$.

::: {.callout-note title="Open and closed intervals"}
::: {#def-open-closed-intervals} 

 
Let $a<b\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{+\infty\}\cup\{-\infty\}$.
We define the **open interval** $(a,b)$ as the subset of $\mathbb{R}$ given by
$$
(a,b):= \{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad a< x < b \}.
$$ {#eq-open-interval}
If either $a=-\infty$ or $b=+\infty$, the interval is said to be **unbounded**.

When $a\neq-\infty$ and $b\neq+\infty$, we define the closed interval $[a,b]$ as
$$
[a,b]:= \{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad a\leq x \leq b \}.
$$

Intuitively speaking, the interval $(a,b)$ is _open_ because its boundary points **are not** part of it, while $[a,b]$ is _closed_ because its boundary points **are** part of it.
:::
:::

Not all intervals are either open or closed. For instance, when $a\neq-\infty$, we can define the interval $[a,b)$ as
$$
[a,b) := \{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad a\leq x < b\},
$$
while, when $b\neq+\infty$, we can define the interval $(a,b]$ as
$$
(a,b] := \{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad a < x \leq b\}, 
$$
and it's clear that these interval are neither open nor closed in the sense of @def-open-closed-intervals




In the following, it will be useful to also consider the **symmetric open interval**
$$
I_{x_{0},\epsilon}\equiv(x_{0}-\epsilon, x_{0}+\epsilon)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad x_{0}-\epsilon < x < x_{0} + \epsilon\}
$$
centered at $x_{0}\in\mathbb{R}$ with length $2\epsilon$ with $\epsilon>0$. It is not hard to see that if $x\in I_{x_{0},\epsilon}$, then either $x-x_{0}< \epsilon$  or $x_{0} - x <\epsilon$. It then follows that $|x-x_{0}|<\epsilon$, so that
$$ 
I_{x_{0},\epsilon}=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\,| \quad d(x_{0},x)<\epsilon\}. 
$$
Therefore, the symmetric open intervals of $\mathbb{R}$ may be determined through the distance function.




# The definition of limit




# Properties of limits

 
 
Let us start considering the constant function $f(x)=c$ with $x\in\mathbb{R}$, and prove that
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}} f(x)= f(x_{0}).
$$
Indeed, it immediately follows that $|f(x) - f(x_{0})|=0<\epsilon$ for every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ and every $\epsilon>0$.
Now, let us consider the function $f(x)=x$, and prove that
$$ 
\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}} f(x)= f(x_{0}). 
$$
Again, it is immediate to check that $|f(x) - f(x_{0})|=|x - x_{0}|$, and thus, taking $\delta_{\epsilon}< \epsilon$, we get that $|x - x_{0}|<\delta_{\epsilon}$ implies $|f(x) - f(x_{0})|<\epsilon$. 
Finally, let us consider the function $f(x)=x^{2}$, and prove that 
$$ 
\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}} f(x)= f(x_{0}) 
$$
for every $x_{0}\in\mathbb{R}$.  We have 
$$ 
|x^{2} - x_{0}^{2}| =|(x+x_{0})(x-x_{0})|\leq |x + x_{0}||x-x_{0}| . 
$$
Recall that we must check that $|f(x) - f(x_{0})|< \epsilon$ whenever $|x - x_{0}|<\delta$, with $\delta>0$ to be determined depending on $\epsilon>0$.  A direct computation shows that 
$$ 
| x+ x_{0}| =|x - x_{0} + 2x_{0}|\leq |x - x_{0}| + 2|x_{0}| 
$$
so that 
$$ 
|x^{2} - x_{0}^{2}|\leq (|x - x_{0}| + 2|x_{0}|)\,|x-x_{0}| < (2|x_{0}| + \delta_{\epsilon})\,\delta_{\epsilon}. 
$$
Therefore, if 
$$ 
\delta_{\epsilon}^{2} + 2|x_{0}| \delta_{\epsilon} - \epsilon<0 
$$
we are done. By solving the previous [quadratic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation) in the variable $\delta_{\epsilon}$ we obtain the condition 
$$ 
0 < \delta_{\epsilon} <  \sqrt{x^{2}_{0} + \epsilon} -|x_{0}| = \sqrt{x^{2}_{0} + \epsilon} - \sqrt{x^{2}_{0}}. 
$$
