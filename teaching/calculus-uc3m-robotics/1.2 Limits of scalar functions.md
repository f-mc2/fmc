# Distance and intervals

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a function. The notion of limit formalizes, rigorously, what happens to the output when the inputs gets closer and closer to a fixed value. Roughly speaking, we write
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}} f(x)=l
$$
meaning that the output $f(x)$ gets closer to $l$ if the input $x$ is closer to $x_{0}$. 

Note that , in general, it is not always true that a limit exists.

In order to make things precise, we first need to understand what we mean when we say that something is closer to a fixed value. In the case of real numbers, if we fix $x_{0}\in \mathbb{R}$, we say that $x_{1}$ is closer than $x_{2}$ if
$$
|x_{1}- x_{0}|\leq |x_{2} - x_{0}|.
$$
If $\leq$ is replaced by $<$, we say it is *strictly smaller*.

>[!remark] Remark
>An intuitive reason for $d$ to measure distances follows from our direct experience, for instance with ruled paper (can you guess why/how?),  but there are also more abstract reasons connected with the theory of [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space).

Besides the notion of distance between real numbers, we need to introduce various types of intervals. These objects help in formalizing the way $x$ approaches $x_{0}$.

>[!definition] Definition: open and closed intervals

>$$
>(a,b):= \{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad a< x < b \},
>$$

>$$
>[a,b]:= \{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad a\leq x \leq b \}.
>$$

^19990d
 
Intuitively speaking, the interval $(a,b)$ is _open_ because its boundary points **are not** part of it, while $[a,b]$ is _closed_ because its boundary points **are** part of it.
 
Quite obviously, we also have the intervals
$$
[a,b) := \{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad a\leq x < b\}
$$
$$
(a,b] := \{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad a < x \leq b\}, 
$$
which, however, are neither open nor closed.

It will be useful to also consider the **symmetric open interval**

$$ I_{x_{0},\epsilon}\equiv(x_{0}-\epsilon, x_{0}+\epsilon)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad x_{0}-\epsilon < x < x_{0} + \epsilon\} $$

centered at $x_{0}$ with length $2\epsilon$ with $\epsilon>0$. It is not hard to see that if $x\in I_{x_{0},\epsilon}$, then either $x-x_{0}< \epsilon$  or $x_{0} - x <\epsilon$. It then follows that $|x-x_{0}|<\epsilon$, so that

$$ I_{x_{0},\epsilon}=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\,| \quad d(x_{0},x)<\epsilon\}. $$
Therefore, the symmetric open intervals of $\mathbb{R}$ may be determined through the distance function.

Finally, we can also describe unbounded intervals by introducing the formal symbols $+\infty$ and $-\infty$. In this case, we have the open unbounded intervals

$$
\begin{split}
(a,+\infty)&:=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad a< x \} \\ &\\ (-\infty,a)&:=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad x<a \},
\end{split}
$$

as well as the unbounded intervals

$$
\begin{split}
[a,+\infty)&:=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad a\leq x\} \\ &\\ (-\infty,a]&:=\{x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\quad x\leq a\},
\end{split}
$$
which, however, are neither open nor closed.

# Limits of scalar functions

As mentioned above, the idea behind limits of functions is that of understanding the behavior around a point $x_{0}$ in the input space of the function $f$ under investigation. However, the point $x_{0}$ is not arbitrary. It must be a **left/right accumulation point** for the domain of the function $f$.

>[!definition] Definition: left/right accumulation point
>A point $x_{0}\in \mathbb{R}$ is said to be a **left accumulation point** for the subset $D$ if there is $r>0$ such that the open interval $I_{(x_{0},r)}$ is contained in $D$. 
>A **right accumulation point** for $D$ is then defined in the obvious way. 
>A point which is a left (right) accumulation point but not a right (left) accumulation point is called a **strict left accumulation point** (**strict right accumulation point**). 
>An **accumulation point** for $D$ is a point that is both a left and right accumulation point for $D$.

^772289

>[!example|*] Example
>Let $D=[a,b]$, then every $x\in(a,b)$ is an accumulation point, while $a$ is a right accumulation point, and $b$ is a left accumulation point.
>The same conclusions hold for $[a,b)$, $(a,b]$, and $(a,b)$. In the latter case, we may also let $a=-\infty$ or $b=+\infty$.

Then, the notion of limit is formalized using the distance function introduced above and two numerical quantifiers, say $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, to explicitly evaluate how close we are to $l$ and $x_{0}$, respectively.

The previous definition is well-posed because the left/right limit, if it exists, is unique.

# Properties of limits

The computation of limits through the definition given above is often difficult. As it is customary in mathematics, a set of simple cases is investigated using *educated guesses* (that is, the sophisticated siblings of sheer luck), and then general theorems are proved to help us exploit to the maximum the simple examples solved.

The first type of general results we consider are algebraic manipulations of limits. The following proposition, whose proof is an instructive exercise for the willful reader, essentially states that *the limit of the sum/product/quotient is the sum/product/quotient of the limits*.

To correctly write this proposition, we need to introduce the symbols $\sum$ and $\prod$ which help to condensate the writing of sums and products, respectively. Specifically, we set
$$
\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} A_{j}\equiv A_{1} + A_{2} + \cdots + A_{n}
$$
$$
\prod_{j=1}^{n}A_{j}=A_{1}\,A_{2}\,\cdots\,A_{n} ,
$$
where $(A_{1},\cdots,A_{n})$ can be a finite sequence of numbers or functions.

>[!important] Proposition: algebraic manipulations of limits
>Let $(\alpha_{1},\cdots\alpha_{n})$ be a finite sequence of real numbers, $(f_{1},\cdots,f_{n})$ a finite sequence of scalar functions, and $x_{0}\in\mathbb{R}$ be a left accumulation point for the domains of all the functions mentioned before. Suppose that
>$$
>\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}^{+}}f_{j}(x)=L_{j}\in \mathbb{R}
>$$
>for every $j=1,...,n$. Then, it holds

>2) \quad &\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}^{+}}\prod_{j=1}^{n} \,\alpha_{j}\,f_{j}(x) =\prod_{j=1}^{n}\,\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}^{+}} \left(\alpha_{j}\,f_{j}(x)\right) = \prod_{j=1}^{n}\,\alpha_{j}\,L_{j} .
>\end{split}
>$$
>Moreover, if $n=2$ and $\alpha_{2},L_{2}\neq 0$, it holds
>$$
>\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}^{+}}\,\frac{\alpha_{1}f_{1}(x)}{\alpha_{2}f_{2}(x)}=\frac{\alpha_{1}L_{1}}{\alpha_{2} L_{2}}.

The next theorem is of paramount importance, and is known to humans by many names (very much like the [Many-Faced God](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Many-Faced_God)). Informally speaking, the underlying idea behind the theorem is that, if a function $f$ lies between two other functions, say $g$ and $h$, the limits of $f$  are determined by the limits of $g$ and $h$.

>[!important] Theorem: squeeze (pinching) theorem
> Let $f,g,h$ be scalar functions with the same domain $D$, and let $x_{0}$ be a left accumulation point for $D$. If $h(x)\leq f(x)\leq g(x)$ for all $x\in D$ and

> \lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}^{+}}h(x)=\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}^{+}}g(x)=L\in\mathbb{R},
> $$
> then it follows that
> $$

> Under the appropriate conditions, the same conclusions hold for left limits and for limits.

Next is a proposition that regulates how limits behave with respect to composition of functions. 

>[!important] Proposition: [limit of composite functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function#Limits_of_compositions_of_functions)
>Consider the scalar functions $f$ and $g$ such that
>$$
>\lim_{y\rightarrow l} f(y) =L , \qquad  \lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}}g(x) = l.
>$$ 
>If there is no open interval containing $x_{0}$ on which $g(x)$ is constantly equal to $l$, then it follows that
>$$
>\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}} f\circ g(x)=L
>$$

^c8052c

A useful corollary is obtained when $g(x)= x_{0} + x$.

>[!important] Proposition

> Consider the scalar function $f$ with domain $D$, and the accumulation point $x_{0}$. Then, it follows that

# Continuous functions

^91cff8

If the left accumulation point $x_{0}$ is also part of the domain of the function $f$, it may happen that 
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}^{+}}f(x)=l=f(x_{0}) .
$$
Functions of this type are particularly important in mathematics and its applications.

>[!rem] Remark
>From an intuitive point of view, a scalar function is **continuous** if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen/pencil from the paper, that is, in a *continuous* way.

Just as there is an algebra of limits, there is an algebra of continuous functions.

>is (left/right) continuous at $x_{0}$.

^47f720

Moreover, continuous functions behaves well with respect to composition of functions.

>[!important] Proposition: composition of continuous functions
>Let $g$ be continuous at $x_{0}$ and $f$ be continuous at $g(x_{0})$. Then, the composite function $f\circ g$ is continuous at $x_{0}$.

Two reasons why continuous functions are tremendously useful in applications are contained in the following theorems.

# Improper limits

Let us now consider the function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ with domain $D=(-\infty),0\cup(0,+\infty)$. Since the constant function $c(x)=1$ and the identity function $g(x)=x$ are well-defined and continuous over all $\mathbb{R}$, we [[1.2 Limits of scalar functions#^47f720|conclude that]] $f$ is continuous in all its domain. Recall that, since 
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} x=0,
$$
we can not say anything about the limit of $f$ for $x$ going to $0$ using the limits of $c(x)=1$ and $g(x)=x$  for $x$ going to $0$. However, it is clear that $0$ is an accumulation point for $D$, so that evaluating the (left/right) limit of $f$ for $x$ going to $0$ makes sense.

The first observation that we make is that $f(x)>0$ when $x>0$, while $f(x)<0$ when $x<0$. Therefore, the limit of $f$ for $x$ going to $0$ exists if and only if both the left and the right limit exist and are $0$. 

Then, we can compute $f(x)$ for values of $x$ which are closer and closer to $0$. For positive values of $x$, we see that the closer $x$ is to $0$, the bigger $f(x)$ is. However, for negative values of $x$, the closer $x$ is to $0$, the more $f(x)$ becomes bigger in absolute value but with negative sign. Therefore, both the left and right limits do not exist.

The problem seems solved, but we should not feel satisfied. Indeed, even if we understand that the left/right limit of $f$ for $x$ going to $0$ do not exist, we can still intuitively say that we know how $f$ behaves around $0$: it grows indefinitely when $x\rightarrow 0^+$, and degrows indefinitely when $x\rightarrow 0^{-}$. 

Can we make this intuitive understanding rigorous? 

The answer is affirmative, and leads to the definition of unbounded limit.

>[!defn] Definition: Unbounded limit
>Consider the function $f\colon D\subseteq \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and let $x_{0}$ be a left accumulation point for $D$. We say that 
>$$

>$$ 
>if for every $K>0$ there is a  $0< \delta$ such that, , for every $x_{0}<x\in D$ satisfying $d(x_{0},x)=|x-x_{0}|<\delta$, it holds $f(x)> K$. Analogously, we say that 
>$$ \lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}^{+}} f(x)=-\infty 
>$$ 
>if for every $K>0$ there is a  $0< \delta$ such that , for every $x_{0}<x\in D$ satisfying $d(x_{0},x)=|x-x_{0}|<\delta$, it holds $f(x)<- K$.
>Right unbounded limits are defined analogously. Then, we say that
>$$
>\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}}f(x)=\pm \infty
>$$
>if both left and right unbounded limits at $x_{0}$ exist and are equal.

>[!rem] Remark
>Exploiting the definition of unbounded limit, we can prove that
>$$ 
>\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^{\pm}}\frac{1}{x}=\pm\infty,
>$$ 
>so that the right and left limits at $0$ exist but are not equal, so that $f(x)$ has no limit for $x\rightarrow 0$.

Another relevant instance for which we need to introduce yet another notion of **improper** limit is that in which we want to understand what happens when the input variable does **not** approach a finite value but either grows indefinitely, or degrows indefinitely (when possible).

# Discontinuities

Consider the function $f\colon D\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, and let $x_{0}$ be an accumulation point for $D$. Four possibilities present to us:

1. the limit at $x_{0}\in D$ exists, but either $x_{0}$ is not in $D$, or the limit is different from $f(x_{0})$ (**removable discontinuity**);
2. the right and left limits at $x_{0}\in D$ exist, are finite, but are different (**jump discontinuity**);
3. the right and left limits at $x_{0}$ exist but at least one of them is either $+\infty$ or $-\infty$ (**essential discontinuity**);
4. at least one between the left and right limits do not exist.

In the first case (**removable discontinuity**), we can define a new function $\tilde{f}\colon D\cup\{x_{0}\}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ by setting 
$$
\tilde{f}(x)=\left\{\begin{matrix} f(x) & \mbox{ if } x_{0}\neq x\in D \\ & \\  \lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}}f(x) & \mbox{ if } x=x_{0}\end{matrix}\right. .
$$
This new function is called an **extension by continuity** of $f$ and it is a continuous function at $x_{0}$ by construction. Note that this procedure works whether $x_{0}$ is in the domain $D$ of the original function or not. If $x_{0}$ were in $D$, then we are redefining $f$ at that point. If $x_{0}$ was not in $D$, then we are genuinely extending $f$.

In the second case (**jump discontinuity**), whether $x_{0}$ lies in $D$ or not, we can not redefine $f$ in such a way that the result is a continuous function at $x_{0}$. The best we can do is obtain an extension of $f$ which is either left or right continuous at $x_{0}$.

In the third case (**essential singularity**), there is nothing we can do to ameliorate the discontinuities of the function $f$. This is the case considered in [[1.2 Limits of scalar functions#^343b10|a previous]] example.
