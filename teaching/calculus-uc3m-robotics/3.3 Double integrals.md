# Double integrals

The double integral of $f\colon D\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ over a closed and bounded region $\Omega\subseteq D$ is the two-dimensional analogue of the notion of [[3.2 Integrals|integral of a scalar function]] over $[a,b]\subset \mathbb{R}$. Specifically, we consider a function $f\colon D\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and a set $\Omega\subseteq D$ on which $f>0$, and introduce the set 
$$
S_{\Omega}^{f}=\left\{(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^{3}\;|\quad (x,y)\in\Omega,\;z=f(x,y)\right\} .
$$
The double integral of $f$ over $\Omega$ is built in order to give a rigorous definition of the volume of the set $S_{\Omega}^{f}$ in such a way that, among other things, it coincides with the area of $\Omega$ when $f(x,y)=1$ on $\Omega$. 

Of course, the existence of the integral depends on both $\Omega$ and $f$. In particular, unlike the one-dimensional case, we must be careful in choosing the region $\Omega$ of integration.

When it exists, the integral of $f$ over $\Omega$ is denoted as
$$
\mathrm{V}(S_{\Omega}^{f})=\iint_{\Omega} f\;\mathrm{d}A.
$$
It is then possible to extend the notion of double integral also to functions admitting negative values at the price of breaking the physical interpretation in terms of volume, or allowing for a different understanding of volumes admitting also negative values.

Because of the little time at our disposal, and because of the difficulty of the argument, we do not discuss how to explicitly define the double integral of $f$ on $\Omega$, and simply jump to how to compute it in some quite useful particular cases. More details can be found in [Paul's Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calciii/DoubleIntegrals.aspx), or in chapter 15 of the [Mathematics LibreText](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus/Book%3A_Calculus_(OpenStax)/15%3A_Multiple_Integration), or in chapter 5 of [M-T](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/ca/product/Vector-Calculus/p/1429215089).

It turns out we can evaluate $\mathrm{V}(S_{\Omega}^{f})$ for subsets that are known as **elementary regions**.

# Double integrals over rectangles

The first case we consider is the case in which $\Omega$ is a rectangle of the form $[a,b]\times[c,d]\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $f$ is continuous and positive on $\Omega$. In this case, we also write $R$ instead of $\Omega$. 

Intuitively speaking, $\mathrm{V}(S_{R}^{f})$ is computed as the limit of its approximation from below and from above in analogy with the [[3.2 Integrals#^964215|one-dimensional case]].  ^050619

The following animation allows for a visualization of the approximation from below ([source](https://github.com/FOSSEE/FSF-mathematics-python-code-archive/tree/master/FSF-2020/calculus-of-several-variables/integrals-of-multivariable-functions/double-integrals)):

![[volume_as_double_integral.gif]]

Of course, the integral exists when both the approximation from below and from above converge to the same limit. In this case, we write
$$
\mathrm{V}(S_{R}^{f})=\iint_{R} f \,\mathrm{d}A
$$
as anticipated above.

Without discussing technical details, we write down a magnificent theorem that helps us in computing $\mathrm{V}(S_{R}^{f})$ for an interesting class of functions.

# Double integrals over elementary regions

The definition of double integrals over elementary regions can be easily accommodated exploiting Fubini's theorem recalled above. 

Assume $D$ is a elementary region **strictly contained** in the rectangle $R=[a,b]\times [c,d]$, and assume $f\colon D\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is continuous. We extend $f$ from $D$ to $R$ setting $f(x,y)=0$ for every $(x,y)\in R$ but not in $D$. 

This almost trivial extension of $f$ (denoted again by $f$ with an evident abuse of notation) turns out to be continuous on $R$ except possibly on the boundary of the elementary region $D$. Therefore, the hypothesis of Fubini's theorem recalled above apply to the (extension of) $f$ and we set
$$
\mathrm{V}(S_{D}^{f})\equiv\iint_{D} f\;\mathrm{d}A := \iint_{R}f\;\mathrm{d}A=\mathrm{V}(S_{R}^{f}).
$$

>[!rem] Remark
>When $f(x,y)=1$ for every $(x,y)\in D$,  the double integral of $f$ over $D$, when it exists, coincides with the area of $D$. 

The explicit computation of $\mathrm{V}(S_{D}^{f})$ can be performed as follows. First of all, suppose $D$ is $y$-simple. The integral
$$
F_{[c,d]}(x)=\int_{c}^{d}f(x,y)\;\mathrm{d}y
$$
exists because $f(x,y)$, seen as a function of $y$, is continuous in $[c,d]$ except at a finite number of points (recall the proposition on the [[3.2 Integrals#^54f5d8|interval additivity]] of the one-dimensional integral). Moreover, $f(x,y)=0$ for all $c\leq y<\phi_{1}(x)$ and for all $\phi_{2}(x)<y\leq d$, so that it holds
$$
F_{[c,d]}(x)=\underbrace{\int_{c}^{\phi_{1}(x)}f(x,y)\;\mathrm{d}y}_{=0} + \int_{\phi_{1}(x)}^{\phi_{2}(x)}f(x,y)\;\mathrm{d}y + \overbrace{\int_{\phi_{2}(x)}^{x}f(x,y)\;\mathrm{d}y}^{=0}= \int_{\phi_{1}(x)}^{\phi_{2}(x)}f(x,y)\;\mathrm{d}y .
$$
Consequently, we have
$$
\mathrm{V}(S_{D}^{f})\equiv\iint_{D} f\;\mathrm{d}A := \iint_{R}f\;\mathrm{d}A=\int_{a}^{b}F_{[c,d]}(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\int_{a}^{b}\left(\int_{\phi_{1}(x)}^{\phi_{2}(x)}f(x,y)\;\mathrm{d}y\right)\;\mathrm{dx}
$$
because of Fubini's theorem above.

>[!exmp] Example
>Let us compute the double integral
>$$
>\iint_{T}(x^{3}y + \cos(x))\,\mathrm{d}A
>$$
>where $T$ is the triangular region with vertices $(0,0)$, $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$, and $(\pi/2,0)$. First of all, following the sketch ([source](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/ca/product/Vector-Calculus/p/1429215089)):
>
>![[triangle.jpg]]
>
>We write $T$ as a $y$-simple region according to 
>$$
>T:=\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\;|\quad 0\leq x\leq \frac{\pi}{2},\quad 0\leq y\leq x \right\}.
>$$
>Consequently, we have
>$$
>\begin{split}
>\iint_{T}(x^{3}y + \cos(x))\,\mathrm{d}A&=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\int_{0}^{x}(x^{3}y + \cos(x))\;\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}x=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left[\frac{x^{3}y^{2}}{2} + y\cos(x)\right]_{0}^{x}\;\mathrm{d}x = \\ & \\
>&= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\left(\frac{x^{5}}{2} + x\cos(x)\right)\,\mathrm{d}x =\left[\frac{x^{6}}{2} + x\sin(x) + \cos(x)\right]^{\frac{\pi}{2}}_{0} = \\ & \\ &=\frac{\pi^{6}}{2^{7}} + \frac{\pi}{2} - 1
>\end{split}
>$$

Of course, if $D$ is an $x$-simple region, a similar chain of reasoning leads us to 
$$
\mathrm{V}(S_{D}^{f})\equiv\iint_{D} f\;\mathrm{d}A := \iint_{R}f\;\mathrm{d}A=\int_{c}^{d}F_{[a,b]}(y)\,\mathrm{d}y=\int_{c}^{d}\left(\int_{\psi_{1}(y)}^{\psi_{2}(y)}f(x,y)\;\mathrm{d}x\right)\;\mathrm{dy} ,
$$
while if $D$ is both $x$-simple and $y$-simple it holds
$$
\mathrm{V}(S_{D}^{f})\equiv\iint_{D} f\;\mathrm{d}A =\int_{a}^{b}\left(\int_{\phi_{1}(x)}^{\phi_{2}(x)}f(x,y)\;\mathrm{d}y\right)\;\mathrm{dx}=\int_{c}^{d}\left(\int_{\psi_{1}(y)}^{\psi_{2}(y)}f(x,y)\;\mathrm{d}x\right)\;\mathrm{dy} .
$$
It turns out that being able to exchange the role of integrals could be quite effective in reducing computational difficulties.

# Double integrals and change of variables

Sometimes, it could be useful to transform a double integral through an appropriate change of variables. 

In this case, it turns out that the appropriate way to transform the double integral is through the use of the determinant of the matrix of the partial derivatives of the function implementing the change of variables.

>[!important] Proposition
>Let $\overline{D^{*}},\overline{D}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2}$ be elementary regions, and let $D^{*},D$ denote their open interiors. Let $T\colon \overline{D^{*}}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}$ be a one-to-one continuous map which is $C^{1}$ on $D^{*}$,  and is such that $T(D^{*})=D$. Let $f\colon \overline{D}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be continuous so that its double integral over $D$ exists. Then it holds
>$$
>\iint_{\overline{D}}f(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}A = \iint_{\overline{D^{*}}}f\circ T(u,v)\,|DT(u,v)|\;\mathrm{d}A,
>$$
>where $|DT(u,v)|$ is the determinant of the matrix of partial derivatives of $T$ at the point $(u,v)$.

>[!exmp] Example
>Consider the double integral
>$$
>\iint_{\overline{D}}\ln(x^2 + y^2)\;\mathrm{d}A
>$$
>where the elementary region $\overline{D}$ is the region in the first quadrant lying between the arcs of the circles $x^2 + y^2 = a^2$ and $x^2 + y^2 = b^2$, where $0 < a < b$.
>To evaluate the integral we would have to write $\overline{D}$ as a $y$-simple or $x$-simple region. However, we also note that the symmetry of the problem is actually suggesting to use polar coordinates. Indeed, the equation of the two arcs of circles would then be $r^2=a^2$ and $r^2=b^2$, and the fact that $\overline{D}$ lies in the first quadrant can be implemented constraining $\theta\in[0,\pi/2]$. Consequently, the region $\overline{D}$ becomes the rectangle $R=[a,b]\times[0,\pi/2]$. To be more precise, we define the map $T\colon  R\times \mathbb{R}^{2}$ given by
>$$
>T(r,\theta):=\left(\begin{matrix}r\cos(\theta) \\ r\sin(\theta)\end{matrix}\right).
>$$
>It is then a matter of direct computation to check that $T(R)=\overline{D}$ and that 
>$$
>DT=\left(\begin{matrix} \cos(\theta) & -r\sin(\theta) \\ \sin(\theta)  & r\cos(\theta)\end{matrix}\right)\;\Rightarrow \; |DT|=r ,
>$$
>so that the change of variable formula above implies
>$$
>\begin{split}
>\iint_{\overline{D}}\ln(x^2 + y^2)\;\mathrm{d}A &=\iint_{R}r\ln(r)\;\mathrm{d}A=\int_{a}^{b}\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}r\ln(r^2)\;\mathrm{d}\theta \,\mathrm{d}r= \\
>& =\frac{\pi}{2}\int_{a}^{b} r\ln(r^2)\; \mathrm{d}r =\pi\int_{a}^{b} r\ln(r)\; \mathrm{d}r .
>\end{split}
>$$
>The last integral can be computed using [[3.1 Antiderivatives#Integration by parts|integration by parts]] to get
>$$
>\iint_{\overline{D}}\ln(x^2 + y^2)\;\mathrm{d}A =\frac{\pi}{2}\left(b^2\,\ln(b) -a^2\,\ln(a) - \frac{1}{2}(b^2 - a^2)\right).
