# Limits of numerical sequences

Intuitively speaking, numerical sequences are a discrete analogue of scalar functions of the form $(D,\mathbb{R},f,\mathbb{R})$. Following this idea, we will develop a way to discuss limits of numerical sequences in analogy with [[1.2 Limits of scalar functions|limits of scalar functions]]. 

>[!defn] Definition
>A numerical sequence is a function $a\colon \mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. A numerical sequence is also written as $\{a_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ (or just $\{a_{n}\}$, depending on the degree of laziness) where $a_{n}=a(n)$. 
>A numerical sequence is called:
>- **increasing** if $a_{n}<a_{n+1}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$;
>- **non-decreasing** if $a_{n}\leq a_{n+1}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$;
>- **decreasing** if $a_{n}>a_{n+1}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$;
>- **non-increasing** if $a_{n}\geq a_{n+1}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$;
>- **monotonic** if it satisfies any of the previous conditions;
>- **bounded from above** if there exists $B\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $a_{n}\leq B$  for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$;
>- **bounded from below** if there exists $B\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $a_{n}\geq B$  for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$;
>- **bounded** if it is both bounded from above and below.
>
>A numerical sequence $\{b_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a **subsequence** of the numerical sequence $\{a_{m}\}_{m\in\mathbb{N}}$ if $b_{n}=a_{n}$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$.

Obvious examples of numerical sequences are given by

$$
a_{n}= n, \quad a_{n}=n^{2},\quad a_{n}=n + (n-4)^{2}.
$$

>[!rem] Remark: numerical sequences and scalar functions
>It is clear that every scalar function $(D,\mathbb{R},f,\mathbb{R})$ such that $[0,+\infty)\subseteq D$ gives rise to a numerical sequence setting
>$$
>a_{n}=f(n).
>$$
>However, the converse is not true. The prototypical example of numerical sequence that can not be obtained from a scalar function is
>$$
>a_{n}=n!= \left\{\begin{matrix}1 & \mbox{ if } n=0,1 \\  n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots 2 & \mbox{ if } n>1 \end{matrix}\right.,  
>$$
>where $n!$ denotes the [factorial of $n$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial), that is, the possible distinct sequences of $n$ distinct objects. 
>Another important example is the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) 
>$$ 
>\left \{ \begin{matrix} a_{0}=a_{1}=1 &  \\ a_{n+1}= a_{n} + a_{n-1} & \mbox{ for } n>1 . \end{matrix} \right.  
>$$

The notion of [[1.2 Limits of scalar functions#^cbf378|limit]] for scalar functions requires the notion of [[1.2 Limits of scalar functions#^772289|accumulation point]]. In the case of numerical sequences, the only possible (right) accumulation point is $+\infty$. Apart from that, the definition of limits for sequences is very similar to that of scalar functions.

>[!defn] Definition: $\epsilon$-$\delta$ definition of [limit of a  numerical sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence#Formal_definition)
>Consider the numerical sequence $\{a_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$. We say that
>$$ 
>\lim_{n\rightarrow +\infty} a_{n}=l 
>$$
>with $l\in\mathbb{R}$ if for every $\epsilon>0$ there is a  $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
>$$
>n>N \Longrightarrow |a_{n}-l|<\epsilon .

# Properties of limits 

The similarity with the notions of limit for scalar functions should be apparent, and could lead you to conjecture that we can actually exploit what we already know to compute limits of sequences. If so, you are on the right track.

>[!important] Proposition
>Let $\{a_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a numerical sequence. Suppose there is a scalar function $f$ and $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $a_{n}=f(n)$ for all $n>N$. It then follows that
>$$
>\lim_{x\rightarrow +\infty}f(x)=l\quad \Longrightarrow \quad \lim_{n\rightarrow +\infty} a_{n}= l 
>$$
>with $l\in \overline{\mathbb{R}}=\mathbb{R}\cup\{+\infty,-\infty\}$.

>[!attention] Remark
>The existence of the limit for the function $f$ is mandatory. Indeed, once we introduce [[1.5 Power series, trascendental functions, and Taylor series|tracendental functions]],  we have that the numerical sequence $\{a_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$  with $a_{n}=\sin(n\pi)$ vanishes identically so that its limit for $n\rightarrow +\infty$ is obviously $0$, while the limit for $x\rightarrow +\infty$ of the scalar function $f(x)=\sin(x\pi)$ does not exist!

The [[1.2 Limits of scalar functions#^ec717d|squeeze theorem]], as well as all the [[1.2 Limits of scalar functions#^55a3be|algebraic manipulations]] valid for limits of scalar functions have their appropriate counterpart in the context of numerical sequences. Two important additional results are recalled below:

>[!important] Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem
>Every bounded numerical sequence has at least one convergent subsequence.

>[!important] Monotone convergence theorem
>Every non-decreasing/non-increasing numerical sequence which is bounded from above/below converges.

^6e7aa2

Sometimes, it may be useful to know if a sequence converges, even if we do not know to which limit.

>[!defn] Cauchy sequences
>A sequence $\{a_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is said to be a **Cauchy sequence** if, for every $\epsilon>0$ there is $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n,m>N$ implies $\mid a_{n} -a_{m}\mid<\epsilon$.

>[!important] Proposition
>A sequence $\{a_{n}\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to a real number (different from $\pm\infty$!) **if and only if** it is a Cauchy sequence. 

>[!exmp] Example
>We now prove that the sequence $\{a_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ given by $a_{n}=c^{n}$ converges to $1$ when $c=1$, to $0$ when$|c|<1$, and to $+\infty$ when $|c|>1$.
>The first case is obvious. For the second case, we note that the sequence is bounded from above and below, and that it is decreasing when $c>0$, and increasing when $c<0$. Therefore, the [[1.4 Sequences and series#^6e7aa2|monotone coovergence theorem above]] implies the sequence has a limit, say $L$. Introducing the sequence $\{b_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ setting $b_{n}=a_{n+1}$, the proposition about [[1.4 Sequences and series#^655116|limits and shift above]] implies 
>$$L=\lim_{n\rightarrow+\infty}a_{n}=\lim_{n\rightarrow+\infty}b_{n}=\lim_{n\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{1}{c^{n+1}}=\frac{1}{c}\lim_{n\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{1}{c^{n}}=\lim_{n\rightarrow+\infty}a_{n}=\frac{L}{c}.$$
>Consequently, $L\left(1-\frac{1}{c}\right)=0$, which means $L=0$ because $c\neq 1$.
>The third case is proved noting that $1<|c|=\frac{1}{|b|}$ for some $|b|<1$, and then using the algebraic manipulation of limits.

# Numerical series

Let us start manipulating how to express the beautiful number $2$: 

$$ 
\begin{split}
2& =1+1=1+\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}= \\
 & = 1+ \frac{1}{2}  +  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \\
 &= \sum_{n=0}^{2}\frac{1}{2^{n}}  + \frac{1}{2^{2}}. 
\end{split}
$$

The procedure can clearly continue for every $n$ up to an arbitrary integer $N$: 

$$ 
2=\sum_{n=0}^{N}\frac{1}{2^{n}}+ \frac{1}{2^{N}}. 
$$

Can we extend it to infinity? This is equivalent to give sense to the equality 
$$ 
2=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n}}. 
$$

It turns out that Mathematics allows us to deal with infinite sums! 

>[!defn] Definition: limits of series
> Given a numerical sequence $\{a_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ we define the numerical **sequence of partial sums** $\{s_{k}\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ as follows: 
> $$ s_{k}=\sum_{n=0}^{k}\,a_{n}. $$
> 
> If $\{s_{k}\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$  converges to $-\infty<L<+\infty$, we write
> $$
> \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}a_{n}=L
> $$
>  
> and say that the **numerical series** determined by $\{a_{n}\}$  is **convergent**. If $L=\pm\infty$, we say the series **diverges**.
> 
> The series $S$ is said to be **absolutely convergent** if the series

>When $x=1$ it is $s_{k}= k + 1$, which means the series diverges. When $x=-1$, it is $s_{k}=1$ if $k$ is even, and $s_{k}=0$ if $k$ is odd, and thus the sequence of partial sums does not have limit, and the series neither converge nor diverge. On the other hand, when $x\neq \pm1$, it holds 
>$$
>x\,s_{k}=x\sum_{n=0}^{k}x^{n}=x + x^{2} + \cdots + x^{k} + x^{k+1} = s_{k} -1 + x^{k+1},
>$$
>which means
>$$
>(x-1)s_{k}=x^{k} -1\;\Longrightarrow\; s_{k}= \frac{x^{k+1} -1}{x-1}.
>$$
>If $x>1$ the sequence $s_{k}$ diverges to $+\infty$, while if $x<-1$ the sequence does not have a limit since its values are increasingly big negative numbers for $k+1$ even and increasingly big positive for $k+1$ odd. The case $|x|<1$ is the only case in which $s_{k}$ converges and it holds

# Properties and convergence tests for numerical series

Some important results are collected in the proposition below (and their proofs can be found, for instance, in Chapter 11 of [S-E-H](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Calculus:+One+and+Several+Variables,+10th+Edition-p-9780471698043)).

>[!important] Proposition
>Let $S_{a}$ be the series determined by $\{a_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $S_{b}$ be the series determined by $\{b_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$:
>
>- if $S_{a}$ converges to $L$ and $S_{b}$ converges to $M$ then $S_{a+b}$ converges to $L+M$;
>- if $a_{n}\geq 0$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, then $S_{a}$ converges **if and only if** the sequence of partial sums is **bounded**;
>- every rearrangement of an absolutely convergent series converges to the same limit while a rearrangement of a convergent series can do everything (**Riemann's theorem 1867**).

Finding the explicit value of infinite sums is very difficult, and we often only need to know if the series converges or not.

>[!important] Proposition: (limit) comparison test
>Given two series $S_{a},S_{b}$ determined by $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$, respectively, if $0\leq a_{n}\leq b_{n}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ greater than some fixed $N$, then 
>$$ \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}b_{n}<+\infty \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}a_{n}<+\infty $$ 
>and 
>$$ \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}a_{n}=+\infty \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}b_{n}=+\infty. $$ 
>
>When $0\leq a_{n}, b_{n}$ but the terms of $\{b_{n}\}$ do not majorize those of $\{a_{n}\}$ for all $n>N$ as above, it holds that 
>$$ \lim_{n\rightarrow +\infty} \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}} = L$$
>implies:
>1) both $S_{a}$ and $S_{b}$ either converge or diverge if $0<L<+\infty$;
>2) $S_{a}$ converges if so does $S_{b}$ and $L=0$;
>3) $S_{b}$ diverges if so does $S_{a}$ and $L=+\infty$.

>[!important] Proposition: root test 
>Let $S_{a}$ be a series determined by $\{a_{n}\}$, with $0\leq a_{n}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and 
>$$
>\lim_{n\rightarrow +\infty}\sqrt[n]{a_{n}} =L.
>$$
>Then:
>1. $S_{a}$ converges if $0\leq L<1$;
>2. $S_{a}$ diverges if $L>1$;
>3. if $L=1$ then the test is inconclusive.

>Then:
>1. $S_{a}$ converges if $0\leq L<1$;

A series of the form
$$
\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}a_{n},
$$
with $a_{n}\geq 0$, is called **alternating**.

>An alternating series converges if $0\leq a_{n+1}\leq a_{n}$ for $n>N$ with $N$ fixed, and $\{a_{n}\}$ converges to $0$.
