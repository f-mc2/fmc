# Sets and numbers

We assume a basic (intuitive) understanding of concepts like sets and numbers (natural $\mathbb{N}$, integers $\mathbb{Z}$, rational $\mathbb{Q}$, and real $\mathbb{R}$). 

>[!rem] Remark: sets and numbers
>The notion of set is not as innocuous as it may seem. For instance, if not handled with care, it directly leads to [Russel's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox). To avoid these unpleasant instances, deep thinking and sophisticated tools are needed (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(set_theory)) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory)).  Similarly, the notion of number is both subtle and deep, and we will content ourselves with the intuitive notion that most humans attending University have already acquired through experience and instruction (but feel free to ask all the questions you want in class). Take a look at this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number) for an introductory overview on the beauty of numbers. 

In the rest of these notes, we are willing to think that the following is a reasonably good definition of a set.

>[!defn] Definition: Set
> A set $A$ is a collection of distinct objects. The set $B$ is a **subset** of the set $A$ if every element of $B$ belongs to $A$. In addition:
> - if $x$ is an element in $S$ we write $x\in S$, otherwise, we write $x\notin S$; 
> - if $B$ is a subset of $A$ and $A\neq B$, we write $B\subset A$ or $A \supset B$, and we write $B\subseteq A$ or $A\supseteq B$ if we do not know whether $A\neq B$ or not.

Sometimes, you are able to list all elements in a set, as it happens with the set $S$ of the best guitar players of all time: 
$$
S= \{\mathrm{Jimi\; Hendrix,\; Frank \;Zappa}\}.
$$

Some other times it is better to describe the elements in a set through a common property (the symbol $|$ means "such that"):

$$
S= \{ x|\,x\mbox{ is a student in UC3M born on February 29th} \}.
$$

>[!rem] Remark: the empty set
> We assume the existence of the [EMPTY SET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20empty%20set,in%20a%20set%20is%20zero) $\emptyset$. The empty set $\emptyset$ is **assumed** to be a subset of every set, and every set $A$ is a subset of itself.

It is possible to operate on sets to obtain other sets:

- **Union**

$$
A\cup B:=\{x|\,x\in A\mbox{ or } x\in B\}\,\Rightarrow A,B\subseteq A\cup B \mbox{ and } A\cup\emptyset = A;
$$
- **Intersection**

$$
A\cap B:=\{x|\,x\in A\mbox{ and } x\in B\}\,\Rightarrow A\cap B\subseteq A,B \mbox{ and } A\cup\emptyset = A;
$$
- **Cartesian product** 

$$
A\times B:=\left\{(x,y)|\,x\in A\mbox{ and } y \in B\right\}.
$$

# Functions 

Let us start with a definition.

>[!defn] Definition: Functions
>Given two sets $X$ and $Y$, a **function** can be thought of as a rule that assigns **one and only one** element $y\equiv f(x)\in Y$ to every $X\in D\subseteq A$ . A function is specified by a  quadruple $(D,X,f,Y)$ where:
>- $X$ is the **input space** of the function;
>- $\mathrm{Dom}(f)\equiv D\subseteq X$ is the **domain** of the function (the set of all $x\in X$ on which the function can act);
>- $Y$ is the **output space** of the function;
>- $f$ is the rule by means of which we associated $y=f(x)$ to $x$.
>
>For the sake of notational simplicity, instead of $(D,X,f,Y)$, it is customary to write $f\colon X\rightarrow Y$, or $f\colon D\rightarrow Y$, or simply $f$ to denote a function. However, we should always have a clear understanding of all the ingredients needed to define a function.
>- The function $f$ is called **injective** (or **one-to-one**) if  it satisfies $f(x)\neq f(y)$ for every $x,y\in X$ such that $x\neq y$ ;
>- The function $f$ is called **surjective** (or **onto**) if its range is the whole $Y$ ;
>- The function $f$ is called **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.


Associated with a function $(D,X,f,Y)$ there are three additional sets to be discovered:

- the **maximal domain** which is the biggest subset $D_{max}\subseteq X$ for which $f(x)$ makes sense;
- the **range**  $\mathrm{ran}(f)\equiv f(D):=\{y\in Y\,|\; \exists\,x\in D \mbox{ with } f(x)=y\}$ of the function;
- the **graph** $\mathrm{graph}(f):=\{(x,f(x))\,|\;\;x\in X\}$ of the function (which is a subset of $A\times B$).

Additionally, important types of functions are:

- **injective** (or **one-to-one**): if $f(x)\neq f(y)$ for every $x,y\in D$ such that $x\neq y$ ;
- **surjective** (or **onto**): if $\mathrm{ran}(f)=B$ ;
- **bijective**: if the function is both injective and surjective.

>[!exmp] Example
>
>Given the rule $x\mapsto f(x)=x^{2}$, we note that  $([0,1],\mathbb{R},f,\mathbb{R})$ and  $(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R},f,\mathbb{R})$ define **different** functions because their respective domains are different.


An incredibly powerful characteristic of functions is that they can be composed (like arrows):
$$ A\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} C , $$
$$ x \quad \stackrel{f}{\mapsto}\quad  y=f(x)\quad \stackrel{g}{\mapsto} \quad z=g(y)=g(f(x))\equiv g\circ f (x) $$


The result is again a function, which is denoted by $g\circ f$, and it is called the composition of $f$ with $g$.

$$ x \quad \stackrel{f}{\mapsto}\quad  y=f(x)\quad \stackrel{g}{\mapsto} \quad z=g(y)=g(f(x))\equiv g\circ f (x) $$

The function $g\circ f\colon A\rightarrow D$ is called the composition of $f$ with $g$. Of course, everything makes sense if and only if the domain $C$ of $g$ contains the range $f(A)$  of $f$. In particular, this means that it must hold $B=C$.

Once we know how to compose two functions, we can start composing an arbitrary number of functions, and it is instructive to check that

$$ (f\circ g)\circ h = f\circ (g\circ h) $$

which means that  the composition of functions is associative whenever it makes sense.

The composition operation $\circ$ allows to rigorously define the operation of **restriction** of a function to a subset. Specifically, if $C$ is a subset of $A$, there is a function $i_{CA}\colon C\rightarrow A$ called the **canonical immersion** of $C$ in $A$, whose action on every $x\in C\subseteq A$ is given by $i_{CA}(x)=x$.

Therefore, given the function $f\colon A\rightarrow B$, we can immediately define the restriction of $f$ to $C\subseteq A$, often denoted by $f|_{C}$, by simply composing $f$ with the canonical immersion $i_{CA}$:

$$ f|_{C}:=f\circ i_{CA}. $$


Given the function $f\colon A\rightarrow B$, if there exists a function $g\colon B\rightarrow A$ such that

$$ g\circ f(x) = x $$

for every $x\in A$, then $f$ is called **left-invertible** and  $g$ is called the **left-inverse** of $f$. We can rewrite the previous equation without mentioning $x$ as follows:

$$ g\circ f = \mathrm{id}_{A}, $$

where we introduced the identity function $\mathrm{id}_{A}$ on the set $A$  whose action is trivially $\mathrm{id}_{A}(x)=x$ for every $x\in A$.

Similarly, $f$ is called **right-invertible** if there is a function $g\colon B\rightarrow A$ such that 

$$ f\circ g = \mathrm{id}_{B}, $$
in which case, $g$ is called the **right-inverse** of $f$.

The function $f$ is called **invertible** if it is both left and right-invertible. ^ac035a
